        <h2>Market Research</h2>
        <img src="/images/questions_infographic.png"  class="responsive-image"/>
        <p>All organizations reach a critical juncture when legacy systems have outlived their usefulness. As is customary in making any important business decision, it is critical that substantial investigation is mounted to ensure that any procured technologies are the best fit for your organization’s mission. The isolation of any service gaps and pain points is the first step in our market research efforts, as they directly inform the requirements that will help push your organization’s processes to the next level. Our market research methodology addresses the most pressing issues associated with the adoption of a new system, including requirements related to vendor viability,  FISMA compliance,  product support and acquisition cost, with a collaborative, multi-faceted sensibility.</p>

        <h2>Shrinking Budgets</h2>
        <img src="/images/budget_infographic.png"  class="responsive-image"/>
        <p>As economic times changed, the sustained reduction of costs is paramount in the minds of Chief Information Officers (CIOs) and Chief Financial Officers (CFOs) who seek to maximize productivity and organizational performance in ways that ensure stewardship of financial resources. Such caution can lead to procurement choices informed more by price than functionality. An ill-advised technology investment can yield huge, prohibitive expenses years down the line for an organization.</p>
        <p>Therefore, any new investment in technology not only needs to serve the business, it must yield a solid return on investment for the organization.  Maximizing ROI implies exploiting the best-fit technology capability with the lowest possible cost of ownership. Proper examination of IT investments helps curb financial quandaries.</p>

        <h2>Solution Survey and Ranking</h2>
        <p>As research progresses and business analysis begins to jell, specific factors will slowly take precedence over others – and it is this hierarchy that will serve as the basis for the development of the evaluation criteria used to rank the prospective systems. Product viability, market position and professional service support are just a few of the features worthy of consideration, and the delineation of those most important to your organization informs the development of an agreed-upon weighting system. Our team seeks out the build-it and buy-it options available by ranking the surveyed solutions based on the parameters established during the evaluation process. The top three performers are then scrutinized with regard to cost and benefit leading up to the presentation of findings.</p>

        <h2>Briefing Report</h2>
        <img src="/images/report_infographic.png" />
        <p>Once compiled, all findings are presented during an executive briefing. Over the course of the discussion, details regarding the “as-is” and “to-be” processes, requirements and corresponding analysis, weighted criteria, market survey results, product ratings and cost-benefit analysis are outlined to offer high-level stakeholders a big-picture view of the initiative. Such information affirms that the Elucid team carried out all due diligence leading up to recommendation. Given that such endeavors have a far-reaching impact, this meeting also provides management with the opportunity to bring forth any questions or concern regarding research, available options or any other outstanding issues central to the decision-making process.</p>

        <h2>Build It Or Buy It</h2>
        <p>Whether an organization seeks to implement a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) product or adopt a custom-built system, best practices should be at the forefront of all technology investment decisions.  The choice to purchase or development your new system - and its subsequent management - will be born out of our in-depth research and analysis of the as-is process; an engaging technology solution cannot exist without proper understanding an organization’s current infrastructure. The specifics of our methods will depend upon whether or not the best solution for your organization is a commercial product or a custom system. For smaller entities, a COTS product may prove the best option, while a custom software product is likely the better option for a more established enterprise with complex, mission-specific needs. Our team can help you determine which course of action is best for you. For more details, see the section below.</p>
