        <p>Adopting new workplace technologies is an exhaustive process. Technology, with its growing assemblage of desktop and mobile devices, is more expansive than ever before - and the number of existing Web applications that power them is infinite. There may come a point at which study of the best options does not lead you to a product that fits your needs. That is where Elucid’s software development capabilities come to the fore.</p>
        <p>We will enable the product’s design to first work in a “mobile” environment, as the world we live in is ever-changing and always on the move. Single Page Architecture (SPA) provides extremely rich, responsive user interface.</p>

        <h2>Modern Web Architecture</h2>
        <p>Our modern Web architecture promotes the development of Web APIs, allowing for the assembly of new applications by combining multiple RESTful Web computing resources. RESTful resources are protected using Elucid's Web Single Sign On (SSO) Authentication and Authorization server. Elucid's SSO is built on the backbone of Spring Security OAuth2 technology, which provides specific authorization flows for Web applications.</p>

        <h2>We Do <em>Scrum!</em></h2>
        <p>Rapid and flexible responses to change are key features of the Scrum Agile framework that informs Elucid software development projects. By design, the framework avoids the adaptive and evolutionary challenges associated with the often-executed waterfall approach. In many respects, the latter technique contradicts the change that characterizes the attributes of technology: Sequential in nature, it carries the risk of leaving critical requirements unfulfilled. Such initiatives progress from the requirements phase to design, development and deployment in a designated timeframe, not allowing for the real-time identification new customer needs and resulting in outmoded requirements. Equally problematic are gaps in productivity, conditions primarily caused by requirements formulation periods that leave developers waiting to spring into action. Pressing needs are simply not met in the most effective ways.</p>
        <img  class="responsive-image" src="/images/scrum_infographic.png" />
        <p>Understanding these limitations, our approach to the development of custom software is a trusted blend of PMP principles and the Scrum-Agile framework. We played a crucial role in helping many government agencies - including the National Institutes of Health, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the General Services Administration - lead the charge in adopting Agile approaches and cloud services.  As the Scrum-Agile framework is a software delivery method based on iterative and incremental development in which requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration with cross-functional teams, it directly influences the construct of the Elucid team tasked to handle the project. We deploy first-rate personnel, including software developers, information engineers, requirements analysts, configuration management specialists and project administrators who are committed to productivity and the continuous evaluation and subsequent resolution of customer needs. Stakeholders have the power to dictate development priorities, thus allowing for the Elucid team to satisfy any and all expectations in a timely, fully engaged manner.</p>
